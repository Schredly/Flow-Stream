Perfect — this is exactly the right level of detail. Below is a **clean, fully re-written version of those same sections**, **mapped 1:1 to the Ita Sigler site**, but **rewritten with *your* story, tone, and seniority**. This is ready to paste into your rebranded site and tweak lightly.

I’ve kept the structure identical so it drops straight into your Replit build.

# Eric Schroeder

## Technical GTM Leader at the Forefront of AI

The technical barrier to building enterprise software is collapsing.

I operate at the intersection of **product, engineering, and go-to-market**, bringing a builder’s mindset to enterprise GTM leadership. I help organizations translate emerging technologies—especially AI and agentic systems—into **trusted, scalable, revenue-driving solutions**.

With 25+ years building, scaling, and selling enterprise platforms, I specialize in turning complex systems into **clear narratives, repeatable motions, and measurable outcomes**—from early incubation to $1B+ categories.

## Career & Personal Milestones

*Key moments that reflect both professional growth and personal values.*

### Husband & Father

Grounded leadership starts at home. I value long-term thinking, responsibility, and building systems that last.

Helped scale ServiceNow from an early IT ticketing product into a global ITSM and Enterprise Service Management leader, contributing to a $1B+ category.

### Product Incubation & 0→1 Leadership

Led incubation initiatives (NowX) launching multiple new products, frameworks, and AI capabilities—bridging early experimentation with enterprise-grade execution.

### Bridging Product, GTM & Enterprise Reality

Consistently translate deep technical capability into executive-level value stories, adoption playbooks, and trusted deployment patterns.

### AI & Agentic Systems Leadership

Advanced enterprise-safe AI and agentic workflow strategies with a focus on governance, risk, and real-world adoption—not demos in isolation.

## Operating Beliefs

*(formerly “Guiding Principles” — intentionally hipper)*

### Lead with Empathy

Great outcomes start with trust. I assume positive intent, listen deeply, and aim to understand context before pushing solutions.

### Build for Adoption, Not Demos

Enterprise success isn’t about what’s possible—it’s about what can be trusted, governed, and repeated at scale.

### Systems > Features

Lasting impact comes from strong systems, clear narratives, and aligned incentives—not isolated features.

### Grit Beats Brilliance

Progress compounds. I focus on steady execution, learning fast from failures, and getting 1% better every day.

### Feedback Is a Force Multiplier

Candid feedback—given and received—accelerates growth when paired with action and accountability.

### Speed With Intent

Strategy sets direction; execution creates results. Small, focused teams shipping quickly within clear frameworks win—especially with AI-native leverage.

### Next (optional, but powerful)

If you want, I can:

* Compress this into a **60-second executive summary** (to mirror Ita’s toggle)
* Rewrite this to sound **more minimal / more bold / more founder-adjacent**
* Convert this directly into a **`content.js` file** for your Replit app

Just tell me the next move.
