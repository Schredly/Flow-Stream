1. Top-Level Page / Nav Sections
(Replacing: Values · Experience · Portfolio · Skills · Get In Touch)
Here are three cohesive naming systems. Pick one “system” and stick to it across the site.

System A — Operator / Builder (my top recommendation for you)
Original	New Header
Values	How I Operate
Experience	Where I’ve Built
Portfolio	What I’ve Delivered
Skills	Capabilities
Get In Touch	Let’s Work Together
Why this works for you:
* Sounds like an operator, not a manifesto
* Avoids moralizing language (“values”)
* Matches your GTM + execution identity

System B — Executive / Boardroom
Original	New Header
Values	Operating Philosophy
Experience	Leadership Track Record
Portfolio	Selected Outcomes
Skills	Core Competencies
Get In Touch	Connect
Why this works:
* Clean, serious, board-safe
* Great if this site doubles as an exec bio

System C — Modern / Minimal
Original	New Header
Values	The Lens
Experience	The Path
Portfolio	The Work
Skills	The Toolkit
Get In Touch	Contact
Why this works:
* Very modern
* Slightly more brand-y
* Works well with short sections and strong typography

2. Reworked “Guiding Principles” → Belief Headers
(No shared words with Sigler’s, same meaning)
Below is a tight, cohesive set that fits your voice: pragmatic, senior, execution-first.

1. Original: Lead with Empathy
New Header: Assume Positive Intent
Alt options:
* Start With Context
* People First, Always
* Listen Before Solving
Short description (rewritten): I default to trust and curiosity. Most friction disappears when people feel heard, respected, and understood.

2. Original: Technical Excellence
New Header: Depth Creates Leverage
Alt options:
* Credibility Comes From Craft
* Know How It Works
* Fluency Beats Abstraction
Description: Understanding systems at the implementation level leads to better decisions, stronger credibility, and faster execution.

3. Original: Leadership Through Impact
New Header: Outcomes Over Titles
Alt options:
* Earned Leadership
* Influence Through Results
* Enable, Don’t Control
Description: Leadership is measured by the success of teams and customers—not hierarchy. My focus is enablement, alignment, and accountability.

4. Original: Grit > Talent
New Header: Consistency Compounds
Alt options:
* Progress Beats Brilliance
* Momentum Matters
* Show Up Daily
Description: Sustained effort and learning through setbacks outperform raw talent. Small gains, repeated, create real advantage.

5. Original: Feedback Is Growth
New Header: Shorten the Loop
Alt options:
* Learn in Real Time
* Say It Early
* Iterate Fast
Description: Candid feedback applied quickly accelerates growth—for individuals, teams, and products.

6. Original: Speed With Purpose
New Header: Bias Toward Action
Alt options:
* Direction + Velocity
* Ship With Intent
* Execution Wins
Description: Clear strategy matters, but progress requires motion. Focused teams that execute quickly—especially with AI-native leverage—win.

3. Recommended Final Set (if I were shipping this)
Nav / Sections
