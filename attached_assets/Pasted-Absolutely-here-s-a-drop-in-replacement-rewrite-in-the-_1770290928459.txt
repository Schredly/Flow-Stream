## Technical GTM Consultant for Enterprise AI That Ships, Sells, and Scales

**Enterprise teams are under pressure to “do AI.”**
But most efforts stall in pilots, disconnected demos, or features customers don’t trust or adopt.

I work with founders and enterprise leaders to turn emerging tech—especially **AI and agentic systems**—into **revenue-driving, production-ready platforms**. I operate across **product, engineering, and go-to-market** with a builder’s mindset: diagnosing what’s blocking adoption, aligning teams, and delivering clear narratives and repeatable execution.

With **25+ years** building, scaling, and selling enterprise software, I specialize in helping organizations:

* translate complex systems into **clear value stories**
* design **trusted** AI workflows with governance baked in
* build **repeatable GTM motions**
* accelerate adoption from first deployment to durable expansion

### Husband & Father

Helped scale ServiceNow from early IT ticketing into a global ITSM and Enterprise Service Management leader—contributing to a $1B+ category.

### Product Incubation & 0→1 Leadership

Founded and led incubation initiatives (NowX), launching 20+ net-new products and AI capabilities—bridging experimentation with enterprise-grade execution.

### Bridging Product, GTM & Enterprise Reality

Known for translating deep technical capability into executive-ready narratives, adoption playbooks, and scalable deployment patterns.

## How I Operate

What clients can expect when we work together.

### Assume Positive Intent

I default to trust and curiosity. Customers move faster when teams feel heard, respected, and aligned.

### Depth Creates Leverage

I go deep enough to earn credibility with engineering and implementation teams—then translate that into clear decisions and direction.

### Outcomes Over Titles

I optimize for results and customer impact. Alignment, enablement, and accountability beat hierarchy every time.

### Consistency Compounds

Big outcomes come from small, sustained gains—repeated learning cycles, steady execution, and operational discipline.

### Shorten the Loop

Fast feedback and fast iteration accelerate product quality, sales confidence, and customer adoption.

### Bias Toward Action

Strategy matters, but outcomes require motion. Focused teams executing with AI-native leverage win.

## Let’s Work Together

If you’re serious about moving AI from pilots to production—and aligning product, engineering, and GTM so it **ships, sells, and scales**—let’s connect.

I typically start with a working session to understand your goals, friction points, and path to measurable outcomes.
